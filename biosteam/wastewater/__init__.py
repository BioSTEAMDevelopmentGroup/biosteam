This module contains all wastewater treatment systems and associated unit operations.
The main interface to create a wastewater treatment system is the
:func:`~biosteam.wastewater.create_wastewater_treatment_system` function. Please checkout each submodule for
additional details on the available wastewater treatment systems.

    """
    Create a wastewater treatment system. Two configurations are available: 
    conventional and high-rate. The conventional configuration is based on the 
    process described in Humbird et al., while the high-rate process is based 
    on the one described in Li et al. Both configurations are designed to use
    biological processes to remove organics in the wastewater, and use reverse 
    osmosis to remove the ions, after which the treated water is recycled as 
    process water to be used in the biorefinery.
    
    The main differences between the configurations is that the conventional process
    uses large anaerobic and aerobic basins for organic removal, 
    which has a very low organic loading (grams COD/L/d).
    While the high-rate process uses high-rate anaerobic technologies including
    internal circulation and anaerobic membrane bioreactor with a much higher
    organic loading (>10X of the conventional ones). With the much higher organic 
    loading rate (smaller reactor and physical footprint)
    and the use of two anaerobic unit operations 
    (anaerobic process does not need aeration therefore saves electricity),
    the high-rate process is expected to have lower CAPEX/OPEX with 
    lower environmental impacts
    (see the example for MESP comparison for the corn stover biorefinery).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    *args: 
        These parameters will be passed to either 
        :func:`~biosteam.wastewater.conventional.create_conventional_wastewater_treatment_system` or
        :func:`~biosteam.wastewater.high_rate.system.create_high_rate_wastewater_treatment_system`
        depending on the configuration.
    kind : str, optional
        Either 'conventional' for the conventional configuration,
        or "high-rate" for the high-rate process. Defaults to 'conventional'.
    
    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs : 
        All remaining parameters will be passed to either 
        :func:`~biosteam.wastewater.conventional.create_conventional_wastewater_treatment_system` or
        :func:`~biosteam.wastewater.high_rate.system.create_high_rate_wastewater_treatment_system`
        depending on the configuration.
        
    Examples
    --------
    Calculate the minimum ethanol selling price of the corn stover biorefinery 
    with either the conventional or high-rate wastewater treatment configurations:
    
    >>> import biosteam as bst
    >>> from biorefineries import cornstover as cs
    >>> bst.settings.set_thermo(cs.create_chemicals())
    >>> def get_MESP(**WWT_kwargs):
    ...     bst.main_flowsheet.set_flowsheet(WWT_kwargs['kind'])
    ...     # WWT_kwargs will be passed to the wastewater treatment system creator
    ...     sys = cs.create_system(WWT_kwargs=WWT_kwargs) 
    ...     sys.simulate()
    ...     tea = cs.create_tea(sys)
    ...     ethanol = sys.get_outlet('ethanol')
    ...     MESP = tea.solve_price(ethanol) * cs.ethanol_density_kggal
    ...     print(f"{WWT_kwargs['kind']} MESP: ${MESP:.1f}/gal")
    
    >>> # With the conventional WWT process
    >>> get_MESP(kind='conventional')
    conventional MESP: $2.1/gal
    
    >>> # With the high-rate WWT process
    >>> get_MESP(process_ID=6, kind='high-rate')
    high-rate MESP: $1.5/gal
