    Create a ProcessWaterCenter object that takes care of balancing the amount
    of make-up water required for the process. The capital cost and power
    are based on the flow rate of process and make-up water as in [1]_.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ins : stream sequence
        [0] Clean water.
        
        [1] Make-up water.
        
        [2] Recycled process water
    outs : stream
        [0] Process water.
        
        [1] Waste.
    makeup_water_streams : streams, optional
        All fresh makeup water streams (must be a subset of `process_water_streams`).
        Defaults to boiler and cooling tower make-up water streams at run times.
    process_water_streams : streams, optional
        All process water streams (including makeup water streams).
        Defaults to all fresh process water streams within the system at 
        run time.
