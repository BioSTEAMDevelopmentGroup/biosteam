    Return the driving force for mass transfer. In small vessels (<1 m tall) 
    where both liquid concentration and saturation are almost constant, the simple
    form is adequate [1]_. In tall vessels, the log-mean driving force should be 
    used for more accuracy, since both the local concentration and the saturation
    concentration are different in the top and bottom of a bioreactor [1]_. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    C_sat_out : float
        Saturated concentration entering the bioreactor.
    C_sat_out : float
        Saturated concentration exiting the bioreactor.
    C_out : float, optional
        Outlet concentration. 
    C_in : float
        Inlet concentration. Defaults to the outlet concentration, which
        assumes perfect mixing and oxygen uptake rate is the same everywhere.
