    """
    Create a Junction object that copies specifications from `upstream`
    to `downstream`. This serves to connect streams with different
    Species object.
    
    Parameters
    ----------    
    upstream=None : Stream or str, defaults to missing stream
        Stream that will be copied to `downstream`.
    downstream="" : Stream or str, defaults to new stream
        Flow rate, T, P, and phase information
        will be copied from `upstream` to this stream.
        If None, stream will be missing.
    species=None : list[str], defaults to all species in common
        IDs of species to be passed down.
    
    Examples
    --------
    Create a Junction object and connect streams with different Species objects:
        
    >>> from biosteam import *
    >>> settings.set_thermo(['Water'])
    >>> s1 = Stream('s1', Water=20)
    >>> settings.set_thermo(['Ethanol', 'Water'], cache=True)
    >>> s2 = Stream('s2') # Note that s2 and s1 have different chemicals defined
    >>> J1 = units.Junction('J1', s1, s2)
    >>> J1.simulate()
    >>> J1.show()
