class SludgeHandling(bst.Unit):
    '''
    A generic class for handling of wastewater treatment sludge.

    The 0th outs is the water-rich supernatant (effluent) and
    the 1st outs is the solid-rich sludge.

    Two pumps (one for the supernatant and one for sludge) are included.

    Separation split is determined by the moisture (i.e., water) content
    of the sludge, soluble chemicals will have the same split as water,
    insolubles chemicals will all go to the retentate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sludge_moisture : float
        Moisture content of the sludge, [wt% water].
    solubles : tuple
        IDs of the soluble chemicals.
        Note that all chemicals that are not included in this tuple and not
        locked as gas phase (i.e., `chemical.locked_state` != "g") will be
        treated as solids in simulation.

class BeltThickener(SludgeHandling):
    '''
    Gravity belt thickener (GBT) designed based on the manufacture specification
    data sheet. [1]_

    The 0th outs is the water-rich supernatant (effluent) and
    the 1st outs is the solid-rich sludge.

    Key parameters include:

        - Capacity: 80-100 m3/h.
