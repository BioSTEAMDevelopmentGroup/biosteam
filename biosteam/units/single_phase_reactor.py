class SinglePhaseReactor(AbstractStirredTankReactor):
    '''    
    Class for a single phase stirred tank reactor, modeled as a pressure vessel with 
    a given aspect ratio and residence time. A pump-heat exchanger recirculation 
    loop is used to satisfy the duty, if any. By default, a turbine agitator is
    also included if the power usage,`kW_per_m3` , is positive. A vacuum 
    system is also automatically added if the operating pressure is at a vacuum. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    tau :
        Residence time [hr].
    T : 
        Operating temperature [K].
    P : 
        Operating pressure [Pa].
    dT_hx_loop : 
        Maximum change in temperature for the heat exchanger loop. Defaults to 5 K.
    V_wf : 
        Fraction of working volume over total volume. Defaults to 0.8.
    V_max :
        Maximum volume of a reactor [m3]. Defaults to 355.
    kW_per_m3: 
        Power usage of agitator. Defaults to 0.985 [kW / m3] converted from 
        5 hp/1000 gal as in [1]_, for liquidâ€“liquid reaction or extraction.
    vessel_material : 
        Vessel material. Defaults to 'Stainless steel 316'.
    vessel_type : 
        Vessel type. Valid options are 'Horizontal' or 'Vertical'. Defaults to 'Vertical'
    batch :
        Whether to use batch operation mode. If False, operation mode is continuous.
        Defaults to `continuous`.
    tau_0 : 
        Cleaning and unloading time (if batch mode). Defaults to 3 hr.
    N_reactors :
        Number of reactors.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The recirculation loop takes into account the required flow rate needed to
    reach the maximum temperature change of the heat exchanger, `dT_hx_loop`. 
    Increasing `dT_hx_loop` decreases the required recirculation flow rate and
    therefore decreases pump costs.
    
    When parallel reactors are required, one recirculation loop (each with a
    pump and heat exchanger) is assumed. Although it is possible to use the
    same recirculation loop for all reactors, this conservative assumption allows
    for each reactor to be operated independently from each other.
    
    The capital cost for agitators are not yet included in
