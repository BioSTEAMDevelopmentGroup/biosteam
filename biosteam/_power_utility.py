    The default price is 0.0782 USD/kWhr as suggested in [1]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a PowerUtility object:
    
    >>> pu = PowerUtility()
    >>> pu
    PowerUtility(consumption=0.0, production=0.0)
    
    PowerUtility objects have `consumption` and `production` attributes
    which are updated when setting the rate with the assumption that
    a positive rate means no production (only consumption) and a negative
    rate means no consumption (only production).
    
    >>> pu(rate=-500)
    >>> pu.consumption, pu.production
    (0.0, 500.0)
    
    >>> pu(rate=500.)
    >>> pu.consumption, pu.production
    (500.0, 0.0)
    
    It is possible to have both consumption and production by setting these
    attributes individually (instead of setting rate)
    
    >>> pu.production = 100. 
    >>> pu.rate
    400.0
    
    Notice how the rate is equal to the consumption minus the production.
    
    The cost is available as a property:
    
    >>> pu.cost # USD/hr
    31.28
    
    It may be useful to print results in different units of measure:
    
    >>> pu.show(rate='BTU/s')
    PowerUtility:
     consumption: 474 BTU/s
     production: 94.8 BTU/s
     rate: 379 BTU/s
     cost: 31.3 USD/hr
