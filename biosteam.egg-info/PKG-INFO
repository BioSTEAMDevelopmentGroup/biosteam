        What is BioSTEAM?
        -----------------
        
        BioSTEAM is an open source process simulation package in Python for fast and flexible preliminary technoeconomic analysis. It is still in its developmental phase with its first alpha release expected in June 2019.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Get the latest version of BioSTEAM from
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/biosteam/
        
        If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:
        
            $ pip install biosteam
        
        To get the git version, run:
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/yoelcortes/biosteam
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        BioSTEAM's documentation is available on the web:

        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        BioSTEAM objects serve as basic building blocks to design and simulate a biorefinery. These include objects that handle material properties, material flows, unit operations, recycle loops and process specifications. To get started, please visit the `Tutorial <https://biosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial.html>`__.
        
        Bug reports
