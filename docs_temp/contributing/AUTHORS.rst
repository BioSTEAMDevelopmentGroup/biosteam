The development of the BioSTEAM software was greatly expedited thanks to 
third-party, open-source chemical engineering software which have provided
critical functionality to BioSTEAM. Special thanks to  `Caleb Bell <https://github.com/CalebBell>`__,
who has coordinated efforts with the lead BioSTEAM developer to tailor functionality of 
his open-source software to the needs of the BioSTEAM software:
