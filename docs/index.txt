BioSTEAM: The Biorefinery Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules
=========================================================================

BioSTEAM is an open-source and community-lead platform for the design, 
simulation, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) of 
biorefineries across thousands of scenarios for streamlined uncertainty and 
sensitivity analyses. The long-term growth and maintenance of BioSTEAM is supported
through both community-led development and the research institutions invested in BioSTEAM, 
including the `Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI) <https://cabbi.bio/>`_.

Workshops
---------
Join us for Yoel's Fall 2022 kick-off workshops! Yoel, the lead developer,
will be going over the tutorial in detail, answer any questions, and provide 
help with related issues.

* Aug 8 [10-11am CST]: Thermodynamics

* Aug 10 [10-11am CST]: Beginner's Guide

* Aug 15 [10-11am CST]: Process Development

* Aug 17 [10-11am CST]: Automation

For details on how to join (virtually or in-person), please email 
biosteamdevelopmentgroup@gmail.com 

Installation
------------

If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install biosteam


To get the git version, run:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ git clone --depth 10 git://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam


Common Issues
-------------

* **Cannot install/update BioSTEAM:**

  If you are having trouble installing or updating BioSTEAM, it may be due to dependency issues. You can bypass these using:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install --user --ignore-installed biosteam

  You can make sure you install the right version by including the version number:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install biosteam==<version>

* **Unit and system diagrams are not displaying:**

  BioSTEAM uses `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`__ to make flowsheet diagrams. To properly install Graphviz in an anaconda distribution, please run the following line:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ conda install graphviz

  Additionally, please follow the following instructions for `installing graphviz on windows <https://forum.graphviz.org/t/new-simplified-installation-procedure-on-windows/224#format-svg-not-recognized-use-one-of>`__.
