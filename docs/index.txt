The Biorefinery Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules
===============================================================

The BioSTEAM platform aims to streamline the design, simulation, techno-economic 
analysis (TEA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) of biorefineries across thousands 
of scenarios. BioSTEAM is also leveraged by `QSDsan <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
a library for the quantitative sustainable design of sanitation and resource recovery
systems. The long-term growth and maintenance of BioSTEAM is supported
through both community-led development and the research institutions invested in BioSTEAM, 
including the `Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation <https://cabbi.bio/>`_.

Installation
------------

If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install biosteam


To get the git version, run:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ git clone --depth 10 git://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam


Common Issues
-------------

* **Cannot install/update BioSTEAM:**

  If you are having trouble installing or updating BioSTEAM, it may be due to dependency issues. You can bypass these using:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install --user --ignore-installed biosteam

  You can make sure you install the right version by including the version number:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install biosteam==<version>

* **Unit and system diagrams are not displaying:**

  BioSTEAM uses `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`__ to make flowsheet diagrams. To properly install Graphviz in an anaconda distribution, please run the following line:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ conda install graphviz

  Additionally, please follow the following instructions for `installing graphviz on windows <https://forum.graphviz.org/t/new-simplified-installation-procedure-on-windows/224#format-svg-not-recognized-use-one-of>`__.
