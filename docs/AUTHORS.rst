The development of the BioSTEAM software was greatly expedited thanks to 
third-party, open-source chemical engineering software which have provided
critical functionality to BioSTEAM. Special thanks to  Caleb Bell, who has 
coordinated efforts with the lead BioSTEAM developer to tailor functionality of 
his open-source software to the needs of the BioSTEAM software:
