Installation
============

Get the latest version of BioSTEAM from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/biosteam/>`__. If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install biosteam


To get the git version, run:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ git clone git://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam

Common Issues
-------------

* **Cannot install/update BioSTEAM:**

  If you are having trouble installing or updating BioSTEAM, it may be due to dependency issues. You can bypass these using:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install --user --ignore-installed biosteam

  You can make sure you install the right version by including the version number:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install biosteam==<version>

* **Unit and system diagrams are not displaying:**

  BioSTEAM uses `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`__ to make flowsheet diagrams. To properly install Graphviz in an anaconda distribution, please run the following line:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ conda install graphviz

  You may also need to add Graphviz to your system path on Windows by following these `instructions <https://bobswift.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GVIZ/pages/20971549/How+to+install+Graphviz  +software>`__.

* **Dynamic flowsheet GUI is not displaying:**

  The dynamic flowsheet is built on PyQt5, so double check that your backend of your IDE is suitable for PyQt5. For the Spyder-IDE, set your backend to "Automatic" and restart Spyder:
  
  .. figure:: ./images/Spyder-IDE_Automatic_Backend.jpg

  In Jupyter notebook, run the following line at the start of your first cell:
  
  ```python
  %gui qt5
  ```
