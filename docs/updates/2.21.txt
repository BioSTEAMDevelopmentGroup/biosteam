BioSTEAM 2.21
=============

2.21.1
-------

New features:

* Runtime warning when reconnecting a stream already connected to another unit operation.

* Optional `N_runs` parameter for :class:`biosteam.System` objects for user flexibility in managing convergence.

* Optional `hx_convergence` parameter for :class:`biosteam.System` objects for optionally estimating convergence of recycle loops with process heat exchangers. Convergnce is "rigorous" by default, but can be set to "estimate".

* Optional hooks for :class:`biosteam.TEA` subclasses including the `_fill_tax` and `_fill_incentives` methods.

* Better compatibility with MultiStream objects between unit operations.

* More robust usage of linked streams, which share data on flow rates and thermal conditions.

* :class:`biosteam.Stream` objects now return absolute entropy instead of relative entropy for the `S` property.
