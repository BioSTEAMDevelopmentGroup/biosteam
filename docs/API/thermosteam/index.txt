Thermosteam: BioSTEAM's Premier Thermodynamic Engine
====================================================

Thermosteam is a standalone thermodynamic engine capable of estimating mixture
properties, solving thermodynamic phase equilibria, and modeling 
stoichiometric reactions. Thermosteam builds upon 
`chemicals <https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals>`_ and 
`thermo <https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo>`_, from the
Chemical Engineering Design Library, with a framework tailored to BioSTEAM
for the simulation of unit operations.

Overview
--------

Thermosteam is an extensive object oriented package for the estimation of 
thermodynamic equilibrium, mixture properties, and mass and energy balances. 
The Stream object is the main interface for performing these calculations. 
Before creating streams, a thermodynamic property package must be defined 
through a Thermo object, which compiles the working chemicals, mixing rules, 
and the equlibrium estimation methods. Each Chemical object contains objects 
that manages the thermodynamic methods and makes sure to use a valid method at 
given temperatures and pressures whenever estimating properties.

A functor-oriented class diagram describes the relationship between the core
classes of Thermosteam. Overall, the diagram follows the Universal Modeling
Language (UML) guidelines except for a few modifications. However,
the function signature of callable objects is presented after their name. 
For example: an ActivityCoefficients object returns an array of activity 
coefficients when called with the liquid molar composition (x) and 
temperature (T). Function signatures with a "..." are abstract signatures 
so that a child class may implement a variety of signatures.
