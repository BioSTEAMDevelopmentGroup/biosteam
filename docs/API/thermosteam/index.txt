- :blue:`Properties:` ThermoSTEAM builds upon `chemicals <https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals>`_ and `thermo <https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo>`_, from the Chemical Engineering Design Library, for thermodynamic models and data which become encapsulated as callable property classes.

- :green:`Data:` Chemical objects manage the thermodynamic methods and makes sure to use a valid method at given temperatures and pressures whenever estimating properties. 

- :red:`Interface:` A thermodynamic property package is first defined through a Thermo object, which defines the working chemicals, mixing rules, and equlibrium estimation methods. Then, Stream objects can be used to estimate thermodynamic equilibrium, mixture properties, and mass and energy balances. 

- :orange:`Equilibrium:` Phase equilibrium calculations are handled by callable equilibrium objects. The main vapor-liquid equilibrium algorithm solves the modified Raoultâ€™s law equation with activity coefficients estimated through interaction parameters for UNIQUAC Functional-group Activity Coefficients.
