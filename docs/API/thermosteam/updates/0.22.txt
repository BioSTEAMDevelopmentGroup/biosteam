====

0.22.7
------
* New :class:`thermosteam.equilibrium.activity_coefficients.NISTActivityCoefficients` object for computing activity coefficients using the NIST-modified UNIFAC model.

0.22.6
------
* :class:`thermosteam.equilibrium.SLE` can now perform equilibrium using
  a user-specified solubility.

0.22.5
------
* Activity coefficient calculations for chemicals with missing functional 
  groups models are default to 1 and a RuntimeWarning is issued. Previously,
  an RuntimeError was raised instead.

0.22.4
------

Bug fixes:

* Corrected bug in the gas enthalpy of chemicals, closing enthalpy balances.

0.22.3
------

Bug fixes:

* :class:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction` math operations (including divisions) are now working correctly. Please see examples in documentation to learn how to add, multiply, and divide reactions.


0.22.2
------

New features:

* :class:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction`, :class:`thermosteam.reaction.ParallelReaction`,
  and :class:`thermosteam.reaction.SeriesReaction` can now handle chemical reactions
  with phases changed. For example, Reaction('H2O,l -> H2,g + O2,g', reactant='H2O')
  will be able to react a MultiStream and add products (i.e. H2, O2) to the gas phase.
  

0.22.1
------

New features:

* :attr:`thermosteam.Stream.S` now returns absolute entropy instead of relative entropy.

* :meth:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction.correct_atomic_balance` can now balance equations where the number of atoms balanced is greater than the number varied chemical coefficients.

* :class:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction` objects can now be imported directly from the thermosteam module (e.g. "from thermosteam import Reaction").
