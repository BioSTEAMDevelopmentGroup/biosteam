0.23.3
------
New features:

* The :meth:`Stream.mix_from <thermosteam.Stream.mix_from>` can now mix empty 
  streams.
* Synonymns to all chemicals (e.g. IUPAC names, common name, formula) are 
  automatically added after copiling a :class:`~thermosteam.Chemicals` object.
* Creating a :class:`~thermosteam.Chemical` doesn't require an alphanumerical 
  ID (any string is valid).
* Better errors for material indexers (i.e. imol, imass, and ivol properties 
  of :class:`~thermosteam.Stream` objects).
  
0.23.9
------
New features:

* Enhanced functionality of :class:`~thermosteam.Chemical` objects, including
  the :meth:`Chemical.get_property <thermosteam.Chemical.get_property>` method
  for retrieving chemical properities with given units of measure.
* Non-partitioning gases/liquids/solutes are now taken into account in 
  vapor-liquid equilibrium.
* More robust and accurate liquid-liquid extration algorithms in the 
  thermosteam.separations module.

0.23.10
-------
New features:

* Enhanced functionality of :class:`~thermosteam.Mixture` objects, including
  the :meth:`Mixture.get_property <thermosteam.Mixture.get_property>` method
  for retrieving chemical properities with given units of measure.
