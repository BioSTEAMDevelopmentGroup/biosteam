# Cane Biorefineries and Benchmarks

The `cane` module contains sugarcane, oilcane, and energycane biorefinery configurations, 
as discussed in [[1]](#1).

Getting started
---------------

Three configurations are currently available: (i) fermentation of juice and 
direct cogeneration (DC) of heat and power from bagasse, (ii) integrated 
co-fermentation (ICF) of both juice and bagasse hydrolysate, and (iii) integrated 
co-fermentation and recovery (ICFR) of plant and microbial oil. Either ethanol or
microbial an be produced at DC and ICF configurations. In all 
configurations, either sugarcane or oilcane is crushed to release the juice and 
the free oil is recovered from the fermentation effluent through a 3-phase decanter
centrifuge. In the DC configuration, the bagasse is sent directly to the boiler to produce 
heat and power. In the ICF and ICFR configurations, the bagasse is pretreated 
with liquid hot water, hydrolyzed with cellulases, and co-fermented with the 
juice.  In the DC and ICF configurations, the oil in the cell mass is recovered mechanically with a screw press after drying. 
In the ICFR, the oil in the cell mass is recovered by centrifugation after cellulosic 
pretreatment with the bagasse.

The following table details the options available for loading a biorefinery:

| Name | Feedstock | Configuration | Final products      | Fermentation |
| ---- | --------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| S1   | Sugarcane | DC            | Ethanol             | Batch        |
| S2   | Sugarcane | ICF           | Ethanol             | Batch        |
| O1   | Oilcane   | DC            | Ethanol & biodiesel | Batch        |
| O2   | Oilcane   | ICF           | Ethanol & biodiesel | Batch        |
| O3   | Oilcane   | DC            | Ethanol & crude oil | Batch        |
| O4   | Oilcane   | ICF           | Ethanol & crude oil | Batch        |
| O5   | Oilcane   | DC            | Biodiesel           | Fed-batch    |
| O6   | Oilcane   | ICF           | Biodiesel           | Fed-batch    |
| O7   | Oilcane   | DC            | Biodiesel           | Batch        |
| O8   | Oilcane   | ICFR          | Biodiesel           | Batch        |
| O9   | Oilcane   | ICF           | Biodiesel           | Batch        |

To select a specific cane line (e.g., sugarcane-WT or oilcane-1566) as described in 
[[2]](#2), add the name of the line after a period. For example, "O5.WT" is the 
DC biorefinery processing traditional sugarcane to biodiesel 
(through microbial oil production) and "O7.1566" is the 
ICF biorefinery processing oilcane prototype 1566 to biodiesel (from plant and microbial oils).

For sweet sorghum and oil-sorghum integration, add a '\*'. For example, "S1\*" is
the DC biorefinery producing ethanol from sugarcane and sweet sorghum and "O2*"
is the ICF biorefinery co-producing ethanol and biodiesel from oilcane and oil-sorghum.

The default assumptions on market prices, technological performance, and wastewater
treatment are set to those used in the 2022 publication [[1]](#1). For updated 
assumptions used in 2023-2024 publications (e.g., updated market prices,
oilcane oil contents, and high-rate wastewater treatment of bagasse),
run the function "YRCP2023()" before loading biorefineries.

Here is an example for loading the ICF biorefinery producing biodiesel from
oilcane 1566 using 2023-2024 assumptions. Note that all unit operations, streams, 
systems, parameters, and metrics are available as attrbitutes to the Biorefinery object:

```python
>>> import biorefineries.cane as c
>>> c.YRCP2023()
>>> O7 = c.Biorefinery('O7.1566') # Create biorefinery
>>> O7.sys.diagram() # View autogenerated process flowsheet
```

To retrieve economic and environmental results at different scenarios, you can 
use the Model object:

```python
>>> import biorefineries.cane as c
>>> # Load integrated co-fermentation oilcane configuration producing biodiesel from sugarcane
>>> O7 = c.Biorefinery('O7.WT') 
>>> # All parameters at the baseline scenario
