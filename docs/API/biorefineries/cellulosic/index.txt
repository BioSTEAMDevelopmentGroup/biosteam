cellulosic: Lignocellulosic Biomass Processes
=============================================

This module contains units and systems specific to lignocellulosic 
biomass processing. Various pretreatment and fermentation systems
are available for users to plug and play.

Getting Started
---------------

One full biorefinery configuration is available in this module, a corn stover biorefinery 
design for the production of cellulosic ethanol. This configuration follows all 
assumptions from a study by Humbird et. al. executed with Aspen 
plus [1]_. As discussed in the original BioSTEAM manuscript [2]_, the 
corn stover biorefinery can be divided into eight areas: feedstock handling, 
pretreatment and conditioning, enzyme production, recovery, wastewater 
treatment, storage, boiler and turbo-generator system, and utilities. In 
contrast to the original report by Humbird et al., the on-site enzyme 
production model is not included. Instead, the cellulase mixture is bought at 
the same concentration of 50 g·L–1 and at a price of 0.424 $·kg–1, which is 
the back-calculated cost of on-site enzyme production as reported in the 
benchmark study. During pretreatment, the corn stover is presteamed and 
loaded into pretreatment reactors with dilute sulfuric acid under high 
pressures and temperatures to break down the biomass and facilitate enzymatic 
hydrolysis (Area 200). The hydrolysate is then saccharified and fermented in 
the fermentation area (Area 300). In the recovery area, the beer is distilled, 
and the lignin-rich solid fraction is filter-pressed (Area 400). The stillage 
is sent to wastewater treatment to produce biogas (Area 500), while the lignin 
is sent to the boiler-turbo-generator section (Area 700) to produce steam and 
electricity.
