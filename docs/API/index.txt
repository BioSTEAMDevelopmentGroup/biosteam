BioSTEAM's main components can be categorized by 4 functionality levels:

- :orange:`Automation` of the simulation of large sets of scenarios is facilitated by :doc:`../API/evaluation/Model` objects which define :doc:`../API/evaluation/Parameter` and :doc:`../API/evaluation/Metric` objects that dictate the input and output features of the model. 

- :red:`Simulation` is carried out by :doc:`../API/System` objects, which can be created without supplying any information on the order of unit simulation. After simulation, :doc:`../API/TEA` objects can perform cashflow analysis to solve for a number of financial indicators.

- :blue:`Equipment` design, costing, and utility requirements are evaluated by :doc:`../API/Unit` objects. All built-in and custom unit operations are subclasses of Unit. Adjustments can be made to the heating and cooling agents of the :doc:`../API/HeatUtility` class (e.g., steam pressure, price) as well as the electricity price of the :doc:`../API/PowerUtility` class.

- :green:`Thermodynamic` equilibrium and mass and energy balances are facilitated by :doc:`../API/thermosteam/Stream` objects, which define material flows, temperature and pressure. Chemical properties and models are imported from `thermo <https://thermo.readthedocs.io/>`_, a community-driven open-source library developed by Caleb Bell.
