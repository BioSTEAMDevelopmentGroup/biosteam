2.23
====

2.23.8
------

Enhancements:

* For computational efficiency, :class:`~biosteam.process_tools.SystemFactory` objects can now return a MockSystem object
  instead of a real System object if mockup=True.

Bug fixes:

* Automatic creation of systems (e.g. via biosteam.main_flowsheet.create_system) is 100% more deterministic and doesn't fail with feed forward systems.

* Fixed bug with creation of systems sections. Feeds to the system section which are outlets to units outside the section were not accounted for (this is fixed now).
  
2.23.7
------

Enhancements:

* Added exception in the case that :class:`~biosteam.System` objects are modified
  during context management (python `with` statements).

2.23.5
------

Bug fixes:

* Fixed bug with missing inlets/outlets for default `ins` and `outs` 
  attributes of :class:`~biosteam.System` objects 

2.23.4
------

Name changes:

* The `system_defaults` decorator is deprecated. Use the :class:`~biosteam.process_tools.SystemFactory`
  class as a decorator instead.

New features:

* :class:`~biosteam.System` objects now support python `with` statements to 
  build systems from units created in the indented code-block

2.23.3
------

Bug fixes:

* Fixed bug with simulating System object with multiple recycle loops (flat; not nested).

2.23.2
------

Bug fixes:

* Fixed import related bugs; "from biosteam import *" was not working before.


2.23.1
------

New features:

* New `ins` and `outs` property for :class:`~biosteam.System` objects to set feeds and products to the system.
  
* New :func:`~biosteam.process_tools.system_factory.system_defaults` decorator for setting default values 
  for functions that create systems.

* The :class:`~biosteam.System` convergence algorithm now terminates if the convergence error of each component is 
  below both the absolute and relative molar tolerance. Previously, the convergence algorthm terminated if the 
  total sum of convergence errors were below both the absolute and relative molar tolerance

Bug fixes:

* Bug fixes to -pipe- notation. When connecting a stream to a unit operation with a flexible number of streams 
  (e.g., mixers), the number of streams stay fixed. Previously, stream-0-mixer would disconnect other streams
  attached to the mixer (not just replace the 0th inlet).  
* Bug fixes to the :mod:`~biosteam.evaluation` module for compatibility with version 4 of the chaospy library.
