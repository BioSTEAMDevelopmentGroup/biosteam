2.22
====

2.22.3
------

* Equipment lifetime can now be set in :class:`~biosteam.Unit` subclasses.

2.22.2
------

* Distillation columns can now implement vacuum systems. A vacuum system is 
  automatically implementented when the operating pressure is set to a value under 1 atm.

2.22.1
------

New features:

* Faster and more robust system convergence.

* Smarter and efficient creation of flowsheet-generated systems using the
  :meth:`Flowsheet.create_system <biosteam.Flowsheet.create_system>` method.

* A single :class:`~biosteam.System` object can now handle multiple recycle loops.
  As a rule of thumb, nested recycle loops are still prefferable.
  
* A new 'cluster' process flowsheet diagram can now be created using the 
  :meth:`System.diagram <biosteam.System.diagram>` method.

* A :meth:`System.print <biosteam.System.print>` method to view all nested systems 
  in the path.

Deprecated features:

* `hx_convergence` argument to :class:`~biosteam.System` is gone. 
  Convergence is always rigorous now unless the number of loops runned, 
  `N_runs`, is specified.

Other changes:

* The class attributes `converge_method`, `molar_tolerance` and 
  `temperature_tolerance` of :class:`~biosteam.System` objects have been 
  renamed to :class:`~biosteam.System.default_converge_method`, 
  :class:`~biosteam.System.default_molar_tolerance` and 
  :class:`~biosteam.System.default_temperature_tolerance`.
