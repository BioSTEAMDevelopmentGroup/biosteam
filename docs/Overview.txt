   A simplified UML class diagram of the core classes of BioSTEAM.

`Stream <https://thermosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Stream.html>`_ objects define material flows, and estimate mixture properties and thermodynamic equilibrium. Before creating any streams, a thermodynamic property package must be defined through `thermosteam <https://thermosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, BioSTEAM's premire thermodynamic engine. A :doc:`Unit` object stores input and output Stream objects in the `ins` and `outs` attributes respectively. A :doc:`System` object serves to define a `network` of unit operations, functions, and subsystems, as well as a `recycle` stream (if any). When a System object is simulated, each network element is run sequentially within an iterative solver until the recycle stream converges (in both component flow rates and temperature). A :doc:`TEA` object can perform cashflow analysis on a system given a set of options. Adjustments can be made to the available heating and cooling agents of the :doc:`HeatUtility` class (e.g., steam pressure, cooling water temperature, price) as well as the electricity price of the :doc:`PowerUtility` class.
