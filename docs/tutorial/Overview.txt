   A simplified UML class diagram of the core classes of BioSTEAM.

All data on chemicals, fitted coefficients, and functions to estimate chemical properties are imported from `chemicals <https://chemicals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, a community-driven open-source library developed by Caleb Bell. The `thermosteam <https://thermosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library, BioSTEAM's premire thermodynamic engine, creates thermodynamic property packages by implementing both the mixing rules and the algorithms for thermodynamic equilibrium and by relying on the `chemicals` library for pure component models. `Stream <https://thermosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Stream.html>`_ objects define material flows, and can be used to estimate mixture properties. A :doc:`../Unit` object stores input and output Stream objects in the `ins` and `outs` attributes respectively. A :doc:`../System` object serves to define a `path` of unit operations, functions, and subsystems, as well as a `recycle` stream (if any). When a System object is simulated, elements in the path are run sequentially within an iterative solver until the recycle stream converges (in both component flow rates and temperature). A :doc:`../TEA` object can perform cashflow analysis on a system given a set of options. Adjustments can be made to the available heating and cooling agents of the :doc:`../HeatUtility` class (e.g., steam pressure, cooling water temperature, price) as well as the electricity price of the :doc:`../PowerUtility` class.
