    "[Stream](../API/thermosteam/Stream.txt) objects define material flow rates along with its thermodynamic state. Before creating streams, a [Thermo](../API/thermosteam/Thermo.txt) property package must be defined. Alternatively, we can just pass chemical names and BioSTEAM will automatically create a property package based on ideal mixing rules and UNIFAC activity coefficients for phase equilibrium. More complex packages can be defined through Thermosteam, BioSTEAM's premier thermodynamic engine. Please visit [Thermosteam 101](./Thermosteam_101.ipynb) for details. In this example, a simple feed stream with a few common chemicals will be initialized:"
