    "Dynamically adjusting parameters in a process to meet a specification is critical in designing a production process, and even more so when its under uncertaintly. BioSTEAM groups process specifications into two categories: analytical specifications, and numerical specifications. As the name suggests, an analytical specification is directly solved within a single loop of a system. A numerical specification, on the other hand, is solved numerically by rerunning a unit operation or even by reconverging a recycle system. The following real world examples will explain this in detail."
